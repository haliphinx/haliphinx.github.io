I’m a final year PhD Student from School of [EECS, University of Ottawa](https://www.uottawa.ca/faculty-engineering/school-electrical-engineering-computer-science). I’m working with [Prof. Jochen Lang](https://www.site.uottawa.ca/~jlang/) from [VIVA Lab](https://www.site.uottawa.ca/research/viva/). Before this, I received my master degree from the same lab at 2020, and bachelor degree from Huazhong University of Science and Technology ([HUST](https://english.hust.edu.cn/)), China in 2017.

<strong><em> I am actively looking for industry/research intern starting in mid-2025 and full-time industry work starting in the end of 2025. Please feel free to reach out to me! </em></strong>
